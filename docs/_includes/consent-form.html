      <p>
        Thank you for visiting the SPRITEs tutorial website! SPRITEs is an
        NVDA addon that introduces a new way to navigate tables using your
        keyboard, on google chrome. We wanted to give you some information
        before you continue to use this website. The purpose of this website
        is to provide information or to host a tutorial to teach you to use
        our improved interaction techniques. With your consent, we would like
        to gather basic usage information like time spent on each webpage and
        the buttons or links that you click on or activate as you use this
        website. Please note that this aggregated information can not be used
        to identify you and will be stored securely in a separate location
        from any data you may explicitly provide in this website. Aggregated
        data received from this website may be used to improve our tools and
        provide better experiences, and may also be used in scientific
        publications or blogs to communicate the efficacy of the interaction
        techniques we develop. Please note that you can continue to use the
        website even if you chose to not provide the data mentioned above, but
        functionality may be limited in some cases. This addon, and the
        tutorial are research products and we appreciate any feedback via
        this google form or issues and feature requests via GitHub. Please
        choose an option below to continue.
