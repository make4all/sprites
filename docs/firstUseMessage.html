<h1>Welcome to Sprites! </h1>
<p>
    Thank you for choosing to use SPRITEs table navigation! This
    page contains important details about information SPRITEs stores on your
    computer to help us fix bugs in case you run into difficulties while using
    this plugin. Please note that the information we log does not leave your
    computer unless you choose to send it to us. This information will also
    be cleared once every thirty days.
</p>
<p>
    Below is the information we collect as logs:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Dimensions (number of rows X number of columns) of tables that you
        encounter when browsing the web in Google chrome.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whether you activated SPRITEs mode on a table you encountered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Navigation and scroll keys you press when in SPRITEs mode.
    </li>
    <li>
        Search configurations that you select (case-sensitivity, row/column
        filters) when performing a SPRITEs search. This does not include the
        search string.
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of occurrences, and locations (row and column numbers) of the
        search result. This does not include the data in the tables that
        SPRITEs mode is used on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This information is stored in plain-text on your disk. This information
    does not leave your computer unless you choose to send it to us. To look
    at the log file containing the information described above, and to send
    it to us as a part of a GitHub issue or any other form of correspondence
    we may have in the future, you must go to the NVDA Preferences, then Settings,
    then go to the SPRITEs option, and select the Submit Feedback option. You can also
    access a web-based tutorial for SPRITEs in the same submenu.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not consent to this data storage and collection, you can
    uninstall SPRITEs, and the log file will be deleted upon removal of the
    add-on.
