<p>
    You are given a weekly schedule for a college-level calculus class,
    and your task is to use SPRITEs table navigation to find out some
    important information from the schedule.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        You want to figure out which weeks have exams so you could prepare for
        it ahead of time. How would you locate the weeks with exams?
    </li>
    <li>
        There are some weeks in the quarter where there are no classes on Mondays.
        How would you find those weeks?
    </li>
    <li>
        You want to review the concept of improper integrals and need to figure
        out which sections of textbooks might be relevant. How would you go about doing that?
    </li>
