<h1>Changing both Row and Column Selection</h1>
<p>
    Below is a similar table as the one you navigated before, but you could combine
    the gestures from the last two tutorials to access any cell in the table.
    Remember, after activating SPRITEs mode, the keys graav, tab, capslock,
    left shift will map to row 1 to 4, and the keys 1, 2, 3 will map to column
    1 to 3, respectively. In order to access a cell at a certain row and column,
    you can either first select the row, then the column, or first select the
    column, then the row. You can also press B and SPRITEs will announce both
    the row and column number of the selected cell. After you get the browse
    mode cursor to the table below this text, press NVDA+SHIFT+T to activate
    SPRITEs mode in the table below, and try to access the cell at row 2 column
    3 by first pressing tab to go to row 2, then the key 3 to go to column 3.
</p>
<table>
{% for i in (1..4) %}
    <tr>
    {% for j in (1..3) %}
        <td>
            Cell at row {{ i }} column {{ j }}
            <br>
            {% if i == 2 and j == 3 %}
            Great! When you are ready, press Escape to exit SPRITEs, and press “Next” to continue.
            {% elsif i == 2 %}
            Now you are at the right row, try selecting the cell at column 3 by pressing 3.
            {% elsif j == 3 %}
            Now you are at the correct column, try to select the cell at row 2 by pressing tab.
            {% else %}
            First select row 2 by pressing tab.
            {% endif %}
        </td>
    {% endfor %}
    </tr>
{% endfor %}
