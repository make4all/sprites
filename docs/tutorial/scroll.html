<h1>Scrolling</h1>
<p>
    Now let’s try to navigate a bigger table. Below is a table with 8 rows and 3
    columns. Note that this table contains more rows than there are keys
    available for row selection. However, you can scroll to the other set of
    rows by double pressing the left control key (the last row key), and then
    the keys will map to row 6 to 8 instead of row 1 to 5. To return to the
    previous set of rows, double press tilde (the first row key). For other
    tables with more columns, you can also scroll column-wise by double pressing
    keys 1 (the first column key) and = (equal, the last column key) to access the
    previous and next set of columns, respectively. After you get
    the browse mode cursor to the table below this text, press NVDA+SHIFT+T
    to activate SPRITEs mode, and try to access the cell at
    row 8 column 1 by double pressing left control (the last row key) to scroll
    to the next set of rows, then press capslock (the third row key) to go to
    row 8.
</p>
<table>
    {% for i in (1..8) %}
        <tr>
        {% for j in (1..3) %}
            <td>
                Cell at row {{ i }} column {{ j }}
                <br>
                {% if i == 8 and j == 1 %}
                Great work! Feel free to try double pressing tilde to scroll back,
                and when you are ready, press Escape to exit SPRITEs, and press
                “Next” to continue.
                {% elsif i == 8 %}
                Now you are at the correct row, go back to column 1 by pressing 1.
                {% elsif i < 6 %}
                Double press left control to scroll to the next set of rows.
                {% elsif j > 1 %}
                Now you are at the right set of rows, go back to column 1 by pressing 1.
                {% elsif j == 1 %}
                Now you are at the right set of rows, press capslock to get to row 8.
                {% endif %}
            </td>
        {% endfor %}
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
