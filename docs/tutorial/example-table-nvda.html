<h1>Example Table with NVDA Navigation</h1>
<p>
    NVDA currently supports table navigation using the arrow keys, tab and
    shift+tab, and by holding control+alt with the arrow keys. Instead of going
    from cell to cell using arrow keys, SPRITEs lets you navigate to a specific
    row and column of a table using its spatial structure.  SPRITEs maps row
    and column numbers to the leftmost column and the first row of your keyboard,
    excluding the function-row keys (i.e. the row containing Escape, f1, f2, f3, and
    so on). The keys for switching between rows include keys graav, tab, capslock,
    left shift, and left control. The keys for switching between columns include
    the number keys 1 through 0, and - and =. 
</p>
<p>
    By default, row 1 and column 1 of the table are selected when SPRITEs mode
    is activated, which means the keys graav and 1 would initially map to the
    cell at row 1 column 1. Pressing a column or row key once changes the selection
    to the corresponding column or row of the table. At any point during the
    tutorial, you can exit SPRITEs by pressing the Escape key to start over
    again.

    Below is a table containing flight information from Seattle to New York City.
    Use the NVDA table navigation shortcuts to get familiar with the table. Then
    when you are ready, press Next.
