<h1>Activating and Deactivating SPRITEs</h1>
<p>
    SPRITEs is a mode that can be enabled and disabled. That is, the navigation
    keystrokes you currently use to navigate tables will continue to work until 
    you enable SPRITEs mode, and will be restored once you exit SPRITEs mode on
    a table. We will now learn how to activate and deactivate SPRITEs mode.

    Now, get the browse mode cursor to the table below this text, and NVDA will
    announce “Sprites mode available. Press NVDA+shift+t to activate”, after announcing
    the dimensions of the table. Note that some of the tables in this first
    part of the tutorial include instructions on what to do next inside the
    table cell to guide you through the interaction.
    Once you hear the announcement, activate SPRITEs mode by pressing NVDA+SHIFT+T.
    Then, press Escape to deactivate SPRITEs, and you will return to the current
    keyboard navigation mode. After that, you can press the
    Continue to Part 1 button to continue to the next part of the tutorial.
