<h1>Search Practice</h1>
<p>
    Well done! You have reached the end of the SPRITEs tutorial and have learned
    all the functionalities offered by SPRITEs. The following section contains some
    optional tasks you can do to practice SPRITEs navigation and keyword search
    on the flights table.
    We highly recommend you to complete the tasks to get more familiar with
    using SPRITEs, but you can also choose to skip the tasks and complete the
    tutorial by pressing the "Back to Home" button.

<h2>Task 1</h2>
<p>
    Find all direct flights from Seattle to New York, meaning the "Stops" column
    should contain the value “Nonstop”. What is the cheapest flight among all
    the direct flights? For this task, try utilizing the row filter to narrow
    down the number of rows you need to explore while comparing the results.

<h2>Task 2</h2>
<p>
    One of the New York airports has the abbreviation “JFK”. While there isn’t
    a cell containing only the term “JFK” in the table, SPRITEs search also
    finds cells that contain the keyword as part of the content. Try searching
    "JFK" and find out what the full name of the airport is, and count the
    number of flights that have the JFK airport as the destination.
