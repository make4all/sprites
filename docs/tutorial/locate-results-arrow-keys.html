<h1>Locating Search Results with Arrow Keys</h1>
<p>
    While you can find the remaining search results with SPRITEs navigation
    gestures, you can also quickly jump between them using the up and down
    arrow keys. The up arrow will go to the previous search result, and the
    down arrow will go to the next search result. Note that as you jump to
    the next search result, the table will also realign such that now the
    second search result is mapped to keys graav and 1. With the same table
    below, try performing a search with “Delta” again by pressing F under
    SPRITEs mode and use the down arrow to go to the second search result.
    After you locate the second result at row 7 column 5, press Escape twice
    to exit search and SPRITEs navigation, then press Next to go to the next
    step.
