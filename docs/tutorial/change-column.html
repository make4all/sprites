<h1>Changing Column Selection</h1>
<p>
    Below is a similar table from before, but we will use it to practice changing
    column selection with SPRITEs. After activating SPRITEs mode, the keys
    1, 2, 3 will map to column 1 to 3, respectively, and you can press those keys
    to explore different cells at row 1. You can also press C and SPRITEs will
    announce the column number of the selected cell. After you get the browse mode cursor to
    the table below this text, press NVDA+SHIFT+T to activate SPRITEs mode, and
    try to access the cell at row 1 column 2 by pressing 2 on your keyboard.
</p>
<table>
{% for i in (1..4) %}
    <tr>
    {% for j in (1..3) %}
        <td>
            Cell at row {{ i }} column {{ j }}
            <br>
            {% if i == 1 and j == 2 %}
            Great! When you are ready, press Escape to exit SPRITEs, and press “Next” to continue.
            {% elsif i == 1 %}
            Now you are at the correct row, press 2 to access cell at column 2.
            {% elsif j == 2 %}
            Now you are at the correct column, you can return to row 1 by pressing graav.
            {% else %}
            You can return to row 1 by pressing graav.
            {% endif %}
        </td>
    {% endfor %}
    </tr>
{% endfor %}
