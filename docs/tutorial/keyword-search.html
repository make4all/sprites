<h1>Performing Keyword Search with SPRITEs</h1>
<p>
    In addition to navigating tables by leveraging their spatial structures,
    SPRITEs also offers a keyword search feature to help you locate the content
    you are looking for within a table. 
</p>
<p>
    Below is the same table with flight
    information. Let’s say we want to locate flights that are offered by Delta.
    After you get the browse mode cursor to the table below this text, press
    NVDA+SHIFT+T to activate SPRITEs mode. Then, press F to bring up the SPRITEs
    search dialog, where you can enter the keyword “delta”, and press tab to
    find the search button. You will hear some advanced search options as you
    press tab to find the search button, but we will ignore those for now. Once
    you press search, you will hear another dialog informing you about the
    number of occurrences found in the table within a few seconds. Pressing
    enter will realign the row and column mapping on your keyboard, such that
    the keys graav and 1 will be mapped to the cell with the first result at
    row 2 column 5, which says “Found. Delta”. Note that jumping to the first
    result simply shifts the table and aligns the upper left corner of your
    keyboard with the cell containing the search result, so you can still use
    the navigation gestures to explore the cells around the search result,
    only now your column keys start at column 5 and row keys start at row 2.
    That is, the row navigation keys (graav, tab, capslock, etc.) will map to
    row 2 to 6 and your column keys (1, 2, 3, etc.) will be mapped to column 5 and 6.
    Try searching with “delta” by pressing F, and explore around the search
    result to get familiar with the table realignment. When you are ready,
    press Escape to first exit search, then press Escape again to exit SPRITEs,
    and press Next to go to the next step.
