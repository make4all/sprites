<h1>Applying Column Search Filter</h1>
<p>
    Finally, let’s try applying the column filter. With the same table below,
    activate SPRITEs search and enter “airport” as a keyword. Then check the
    “Advanced” checkbox, and check “Filter to relevant columns”, then press the
    search button. Since “airport” only shows up in the “Source Airport” and
    “Destination Airport” column, the keys 1 and 2 will map to column 2 and 4.
    Then you can press Escape to exit search, which will remove the filter and
    expand the table back to its original state. Just like removing the row filter,
    the last cell you selected will still map to the same column key, so if you
    select column 4 before removing the filter, the key 2 will still map to
    column 4, but the key 1 will map to column 3, and the key 4 map to column 5,
    and so on. When you are ready, exit SPRITEs and press Next to continue.
