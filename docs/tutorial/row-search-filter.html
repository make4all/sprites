<h1>Applying Row Search Filter</h1>
<p>
    SPRITEs also allows you to apply filters to the table such that only
    relevant rows and/or columns containing the searched term will be mapped
    to the keyboard, to make it easier for you to locate the search results
    and quickly navigate between them without constantly realigning the table.
    Let’s try out the row filter first. With the same table below, activate
    SPRITEs search and enter “delta” as a keyword. Then check the “Advanced”
    checkbox, which will enable two more options, “Filter to relevant rows”
    and “Filter to relevant columns”. Check the “Filter to relevant rows” option,
    then press the search button. After the search is completed, since only
    two rows in the original table
    contain “delta”, the key graav will map to row 2 and tab will map to row 7.
    Press tab, and you will hear SPRITEs have switched to the cell at row 7
    column 5, which is the second cell containing “delta”. Then you can press
    Escape to exit search, which will remove the filter and expand the table
    back to its original state. The keys tab and 1 still map to row 7 column 5
    (because that’s the last cell you have selected) but graav will now map to
    row 6, capslock map to row 8, and so on. When you are ready, exit SPRITEs
    and press Next to continue.
