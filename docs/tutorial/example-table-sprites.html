<h1>Practice SPRITEs Navigation with Example Table</h1>
<p>
    Good work so far! Now that we have learned how to navigate between different
    rows and columns with SPRITEs, letâ€™s go ahead and try it on the example
    table with flight information. You might notice that this table has more
    rows than the number of row keys, but we will teach you how to access the
    extra rows next! After you get the browse mode cursor to the table below
    this text, press NVDA+SHIFT+T to activate SPRITEs mode in the table below
    and explore the table. When you are done, exit SPRITEs mode by pressing
    Escape and press Next to continue.
