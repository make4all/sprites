<h1>Changing Row Selection</h1>
<p>
    Before we ask you to navigate the table using SPRITEs, let’s start with a
    smaller table. Below is a table with 4 rows and 3 columns, and we will use
    it to practice changing row selection with SPRITEs. On enabling SPRITEs mode,
    the keys graav, tab, capslock, left shift will map to row 1 to 4, respectively,
    and you can press those keys to explore different cells in column 1. You can
    also press R and SPRITEs will announce the row number of the selected cell. After
    you get the browse mode cursor to the table below this text, press NVDA+SHIFT+T
    to activate SPRITEs mode, and try to access the cell at row 3 column 1 by
    pressing capslock (the third row key).
</p>
<table>
{% for i in (1..4) %}
    <tr>
    {% for j in (1..3) %}
        <td>
            Cell at row {{ i }} column {{ j }}
            <br>
            {% if i == 3 and j == 1 %}
            Great! When you are ready, press Escape to exit SPRITEs, and press “Next” to continue.
            {% elsif i == 3 %}
            Now you are at the correct row, you can return to column 1 by pressing 1.
            {% elsif j == 1 %}
            Now you are at the correct column, press capslock to access the cell at row 3.
            {% else %}
            You can return to column 1 by pressing 1.
            {% endif %}
        </td>
    {% endfor %}
    </tr>
{% endfor %}
