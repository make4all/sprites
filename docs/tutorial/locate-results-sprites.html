<h1>Locating Search Results with SPRITEs Navigation</h1>
<p>
    Just a recap, when you perform a search, SPRITEs jumps to the first search
    result. After SPRITEs jumps to the first search result, it simply shifts the
    table and aligns the upper left corner of your keyboard with the cell
    containing the search result. You can explore around the table under search
    mode with some additional announcements that help you locate other search
    results. For example, if you switch to a column that contains 2 more search
    results other than the current cell selected, SPRITEs will announce “2 more
    found in this column”. As soon as you land on a search result, SPRITEs will
    also announce “Found” before speaking the content of the cell. Now, with the
    same table below, press NVDA+SHIFT+T to activate SPRITEs mode and press F to
    search for “delta” again. After SPRITEs jumps to the first search result,
    try to find the second search result in the table, which should locate at
    row 7 column 5. Once you found it, exit the search mode and SPRITEs by
    pressing Escape twice, then press Next to continue.

<h2>
    A Note about Search Time
</h2>
<p>
    Since the SPRITEs keyword search requires processing the whole table, it
    could take a while to complete a search on a large table. While you can
    still explore the table when SPRITEs is searching for the keyword, you will
    hear “searching” if you attempt to press F to initiate a new search. In that
    case, our advice is to wait patiently until the current search is completed.
