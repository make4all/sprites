<h1>Case-Sensitive Search</h1>
<p>
    You can also refine your search results by checking the “Case Sensitive”
    option in the search dialog. With the same table below, try performing a
    search with “delta”, the lower case “d”, then check the “Case Sensitive”
    checkbox. When you press Search, it should inform you that the keyword is
    not found in a few seconds. Next, search again with “Delta” using the
    uppercase “D”, and check the “Case Sensitive” checkbox again. You should
    now get back the same 2 results as before. After you try out the case
    sensitive search, press Escape twice to exit search and SPRITEs navigation,
    then press Next to go to the next step.
