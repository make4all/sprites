<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    People who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) use screen readers to
    use computers. The linear nature of these screen reader
    interactions makes understanding or navigating hierarchical structures
    like nested menus or tabular content on the web difficult for BVI users.
    To improve the experience of non-visually
    navigating nonlinear data,

        Spatial Region Interaction Techniques (SPRITEs)
    </a>
    was introduced as a novel method for navigating two-dimensional
    structures using the keyboard. the Sprites NVDA addon for Google chrome, a research prototype built by researchers at the [Make4All](https://make4all.org/) group at the University of Washington, builds a subset of improvements shown to improve efficiency of navigating tables using screen readers.
